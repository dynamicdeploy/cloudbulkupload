- **Best performance**: 48.56 MB/s with 10 threads

## How to Run Tests

### 1. Quick Test (Fastest)
```bash
python tests/quick_test.py
```

### 2. Using Test Runner Script
```bash
# Unit tests only
python run_tests.py --type unit

# Performance tests
python run_tests.py --type performance

# All tests
python run_tests.py --type all

# Performance benchmark
python run_tests.py --type benchmark

# With coverage
python run_tests.py --type unit --coverage
```

### 3. Using pytest directly
```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/

# Unit tests only
pytest tests/ -m "not slow"

# Performance tests only
pytest tests/ -m "performance"

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=bulkboto3 --cov-report=html
```

## Environment Setup

The tests use your existing `.env` file with:
- `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` - S3 endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:9000)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your secret key

## Test Dependencies
