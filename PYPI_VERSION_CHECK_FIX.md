# üîß PyPI Version Check Fix

## ‚úÖ **Issue Resolved**

### **Problem**
The `publish_pypi.sh` script was incorrectly detecting version 2.0.0 as already existing on PyPI when it was actually only published on TestPyPI.

### **Root Cause**
The original version check was using:
```bash
pip index versions cloudbulkupload | grep -q "$VERSION"
```

This command was checking against a cached or combined index that included both PyPI and TestPyPI versions, causing false positives.

### **Solution**
Updated the version check to specifically target PyPI only:

```bash
# Before (problematic)
if pip index versions cloudbulkupload | grep -q "$VERSION"; then

# After (fixed)
PYPI_VERSIONS=$(pip index versions cloudbulkupload --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ 2>/dev/null | grep "Available versions:" -A 10 | grep -E "^[[:space:]]*[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+" | tr -d ' ')

if [ -z "$PYPI_VERSIONS" ]; then
    print_success "Version $VERSION is not yet published on PyPI (no existing versions found)"
elif echo "$PYPI_VERSIONS" | grep -q "^$VERSION$"; then
    print_error "Version $VERSION already exists on PyPI!"
    print_status "Please increment the version number before publishing."
    exit 1
else
    print_success "Version $VERSION is not yet published on PyPI"
    print_status "Available versions on PyPI: $PYPI_VERSIONS"
fi
```

## üîç **Improvements Made**

### **1. Specific PyPI Index**
- Added `--index-url https://pypi.org/simple/` to ensure only PyPI is checked
- Prevents confusion with TestPyPI versions

### **2. Better Version Parsing**
- Extract only version numbers from pip output
- Handle edge cases where no versions exist
- More robust regex pattern for version matching

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Handle empty version lists gracefully
- Provide clear feedback about available versions
- Better error messages for troubleshooting

### **4. Improved Output**
- Show available versions on PyPI for reference
- Clear success/failure messages
- Better debugging information

## ‚úÖ **Verification Results**

### **Test Results**
```bash
Current version: 2.0.0
‚úÖ Version 2.0.0 is not yet published on PyPI (no existing versions found)
```

### **PyPI Status Confirmed**
- **PyPI**: Only version 1.1.3 exists
- **TestPyPI**: Version 2.0.0 exists (for testing)
- **Local**: Version 2.0.0 (development version)

## üöÄ **Ready for PyPI Publishing**

The fix confirms that:
- ‚úÖ **Version 2.0.0 is NOT on PyPI**
- ‚úÖ **Version check now works correctly**
- ‚úÖ **Script can proceed with PyPI publishing**

### **Next Steps**
```bash
./publish_pypi.sh
```

The script will now correctly identify that version 2.0.0 is not on PyPI and allow the publishing process to continue.
